NEDmap - Natural Earth Data Map

A web-based visualization tool for and with the public domain Natural
Earth data (naturalearthdata.com).

Visualization tools forked from code.google.com/p/ccf-mapview, a
visualization tool for world climate data (ccc-gistemp) by the Climate
Code Foundation.

Unlike tile-based map viewers like Google Maps and OpenLayers, we render
vector graphics directly.

Standard (index.html, map.js, main.js) renders visible tiles
    only, requiring more preprocessing to create usable vector tiles,
    but with much better client-side performance
Untiled (untiled.html, map.untiled.js, main.untiled.js), while it technically renders only
    those objects at least partially visible in the current screen, must
    look through all vectors just to be sure, so requires little
    preprocessing, but with a painful real-time performance hit
